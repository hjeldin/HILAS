Watchdog keep-alive publisher 
* The watchdog is implemented in two parts. The WatchdogPublisher runs on the human-robot interface computer and the (custom?) WatchdogService listener must be on the robot.
* The WatchdogPublisher keeps publishing keep-alive messages in the '/watchdog/keepalive' topic.
* When the WatchdogService (see for example YouBot_OODL/WatchdogService) loses the connection, it should stop the robot (e.g. stop the YouBot_OODL::TaskContext -> stop the youBot).
 
Usage:
0) Setup the roscore etc.
1) rosrun watchdog WatchdogPublisher <period>
2) Deploy youBot stack -> have a look in the YouBot_deployment package how to do this.

Note: Test the watchdog setup before doing any dangerous experiments.
