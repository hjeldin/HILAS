Our youBot was upgraded to firmware 1.48. The 'old' current control parameters seem to work, but the other parameters were not tested nor validated.

Please do NOT use the YouBot_configurator until you determined new valid parameters.

Furthermore, the youbot_applications external git was removed (not needed without configurator).
