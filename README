==INSTALLATION==

===Prerequisites===
* ROS (electric) installed and setup (www.ros.org)
* orocos_toolchain_ros (corresponding to electric) installed and setup (http://www.ros.org/wiki/orocos_toolchain_ros)

For the UTwente YouBot-stack the following must also be installed:
* KUL motion_control stack (see below).
* youbot_driver without internal thread (see below).

===youbot_driver===
1) git clone https://github.com/youbot/youbot_driver.git
2) Open CMakeLists.txt and change SET(USE_ETHERCAT_MASTER_WITH_THREAD ON) to OFF.
3) Make sure the pkgmanager youbot-oodl is NOT installed.
4) cd youbot_driver; make clean; make; cd build; sudo make install

===KUL motion_control stack install===
* Note you only need the motion_control_msgs and rtt_motion_control_msgs directories. 
Proposed steps:
1) git clone http://git.mech.kuleuven.be/robotics/motion_control.git
2) cd motion_control
5) rm -rf ./cartesian_motion_control ./naxes_motion_control
6) rosmake

===UTwente YouBot-stack install===
1) git clone git@github.com:b-it-bots/youbot-stack.git
2) cd youbot-stack
3) git submodule init
4) git submodule update
5) rosmake

Note: For all installation actions you have to manually adjust the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH probably.

== USAGE ==
Almost every package contains a deploy.ops (Orocos deployment script), which can be used as an example.
Documentation will follow shortly.
