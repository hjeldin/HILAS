=YouBot-stack development repository=

The University of Twente(www.utwente.nl) is not liable for any damage arising directly or indirectly from using the code in this repository.

==INSTALLATION==

===Prerequisites===
* ROS (electric) installed and setup (www.ros.org)
 * Use ubuntu packages, ATLEAST: ros-electric-desktop
* orocos_toolchain_ros (corresponding to electric) installed and setup. 
 * Use ubuntu packages: sudo apt-get install ros-electric-orocos-toolchain ros-electric-rtt-ros-integration ros-electric-rtt-ros-comm ros-electric-rtt-common-msgs ros-electric-rtt-geometry
For the UTwente YouBot-stack the following must also be installed:
* KUL motion_control stack (see below).
* youbot_driver without internal thread (see below).

===youbot_driver===
git clone https://github.com/youbot/youbot_driver.git
Open CMakeLists.txt and change SET(USE_ETHERCAT_MASTER_WITH_THREAD ON) to OFF.
Make sure the pkgmanager youbot-oodl is NOT installed.
cd youbot_driver; make clean; make; cd build; sudo make install

===KUL motion_control stack install===
* Note you only need the motion_control_msgs and rtt_motion_control_msgs directories. 
Proposed steps:
git clone http://git.mech.kuleuven.be/robotics/motion_control.git
cd motion_control
git checkout devel
OPTIONAL: rm -rf ./cartesian_motion_control ./naxes_motion_control
rosmake

===UTwente YouBot-stack install===
git clone git@github.com:b-it-bots/youbot-stack.git
cd youbot-stack
git submodule init
git submodule update
rosmake
Adjust the run.sh files according to where you have installed ros and orocos.


Note: For all installation actions you have to manually adjust the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH probably.

== USAGE ==
Almost every package contains a deploy.ops (Orocos deployment script), which can be used as an example.
Documentation will follow shortly.
