This is a typekit for YouBot messages. 
Currently it is only working for Orocos, but in the future ROS will be added. Hopefully, the struct's will remain functional and only includes need to be changed.

How to make the typekit
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install

How to use this typekit:
* CMakeLists.txt - Add orocos_use_package( YouBot_messages-typekit ) . The Orocos build system will look in its component path for this.
* CPP/header files - Add #include "orocos/YouBot_messages/Types.hpp" . The defined data structures are now usable in code. Maybe you also need to set the correct namespace.

YouBot_messages is the name of the typekit.
