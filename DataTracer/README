== Purpose ==
Store signal data (from hard real-time) into a CSV file for off-line analysis.

== Problem ==
Writing files in general is non real-time.

== Solution == 
The idea is to create two components, with different real-time settings and a buffer in between.
A hard real-time component collects all data and places this in a pre-allocated (big) buffer.
The non real-time component then reads, in spare-time, this buffer and writes the data to a file on disk.
Key is that the threads are separated with a lock-free buffer, such that the hard real-time component
is not influenced.  

The components are split, to allow different coordination scenarios. Furthermore, the buffer 
size (between Sink and CSVFileWriter) can thereby easily be adjusted.

Sink: Collects all messages in real-time (if properly started during deployment)
CSVFileWriter: Writes buffered vector<double> to a CSV file.

== Deployment ==
Please have a look at the example_deploy.ops script.

== Extending the Sink conversion ==
Please have a look at DTTypes.hpp on how to do this.

== Note == 
This component has NOT been tested yet. Furthermore, it is likely that a real-time
operating system is necessary to guarantee proper working (file system writing might block
higher priority threads).
